        <p>
          In the quiet of the morning light,
          Whispers of dawn chase away the night.
          The sky paints hues of soft pastel,
          As dreams awake from their gentle spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sun ascends with golden grace,
          Bringing warmth to every place.
          Birds sing songs of joy and cheer,
          As a new day draws ever near.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let your heart embrace the day,
          Let worries and fears drift away.
          In the beauty of the morningâ€™s glow,
          Find the peace you seek to know.
        </p>
